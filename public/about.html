<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An informatics major student who's currently learning to be a web developer slowly and steadily. Born at Bandung,
   on 28th may. My target right now is to finish this full stack web course and hopefully can create websites of my own.
   Coding and programming is something new to me, and of course i'm totally blind on it. i have no basics, no general knowledge, 
   and anything. But, i really want to finish this course so that i can be atleast a website developer.
   Wish me luck on my journey to finish this course and achieve my goals in the future!.
